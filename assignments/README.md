This folder contains assignments for the Reinforcement Learning course. Each of them is standalone, meaning that they do not necessarily have to be done one by one, although they could require installation of external packages.

First assignment concerns Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms in application to the finite state and action spaces environment. The task is to implement the essential part of both algorithms and to compare their performance.

Second assignment concerns Policy Gradient approach to the continuous state and action space environments. The task is to implement a policy that swings a pendulum to an upward position and to complete a function that numerically calculates the gradient of the PDF for the REINFORCE algorithm.

The third assignment concerns the NN Critic approach in application to the same problem as in the second one. The custom loss for TD sholud be implemented, as well as the core part of the backward propagation.

The fourth notebook is devoted to the core parts of MPC and RQL implementation in application to the wheeled robot control. It relies on the framework that is being developed in the AIDA lab.
